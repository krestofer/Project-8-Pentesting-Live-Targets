# Project-8-Pentesting-Live-Targets
Identifying and executing two vulnerabilities each of the blue, green and red versions of the Globitek websites.
# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: 7.5 hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)


## Blue

Vulnerability #1: __________________

Vulnerability #2: __________________

At first, none of the attackable websites showed an obvious enumeration vulnerability by finding response differences from trying different usernames, even the codepath supplied existing "jmonroe99". Every website displayed the same:

## Green

Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration

At first, none of the attackable websites showed an obvious enumeration vulnerability by finding response differences from trying different usernames, even the codepath supplied existing "jmonroe99". Every website displayed the same:

![web response](https://github.com/krestofer/Project-8-Pentesting-Live-Targets/blob/master/no%20clues.jpg)

Then there was a noticeble difference in the green site's text response. Most of the failed responses weren't coming back bold. Looked back on other sides and most of their output came back the same in bold:

![web response](https://github.com/krestofer/Project-8-Pentesting-Live-Targets/blob/master/Enumeration%20clues%20-%20other%20pages.gif)

Green returned bold only when the username was found indicating the developer handled the input two different ways and revealed it in the output:

Vulnerability #2: __________________


## Red

Vulnerability #2: __________________


## Concept Review

Which attacks were easiest to execute? Which were the most difficult?

What is a good rule of thumb which would prevent accidentally username enumeration vulnerabilities like the one created here?

Since you should be somewhat familiar with the CMS and how it was coded, can you think of another resource which could be made vulnerable to an Insecure Direct Object Reference? What code could be removed which would expose it?

Many SQL Injections use OR as part of the injected code. (For example ' OR 1=1 --'). Could AND work just as well in place of OR? Why or why not?

A stored XSS attack requires patience because it could be stored for months before being triggered. Because of this, what important ingredient would an attacker most likely include in a stored XSS attack script?

Imagine that one of your classmates is an authorized admin for the site's CMS and you are not. How would you get them to visit the self-submitting, hiddent page you created in Objective #5 (CSRF)?

Compare session hijacking and session fixation. Which attack do you think is easier for an attacker to execute? Why? One of them is much easier to defend against the other. Which one and why?
